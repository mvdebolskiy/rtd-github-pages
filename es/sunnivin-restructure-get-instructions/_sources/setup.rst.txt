Setup CTSM
===========

Accounting
----------------

For running CTSM, you usually need to have access to a High-Performance Computer.

If you are working in Norway, you can use either saga, fram, or betzy (depending on demands on parallel computing) and need to be part of an active account:

- Notur

To check which project you can use:

:: 

  projects


This will return something like:

::

  nn2806k
  nn1000k

In the example above, two projects can be used (nn2806k and nn1000k). Then make sure you choose the right project when running CTSM.
